# www.julielizardo.com v2.0
Tired of my previous website design, I built version 2.0! I wanted to include more playfulness to the front-end and have the aesthetic reflect my personality more.

## Summary
I wanted to learn the most popular front-end development tools and explore with new css animations. I have included text animations to slide in the content at the beginning when you enter a page and svg animations in the loading screen when you visit the website for the first time. I also used svg css animations to bring my personifed character on the home page to life. Her eyes follow your cursor from left to right. Try hovering your mouse over her face for a fun reaction!
