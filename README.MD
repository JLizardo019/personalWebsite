# www.julielizardo.com v2.0
Tired of my previous website design, I built version 2.0! I wanted to include more playfulness to the front-end and have the aesthetic reflect my personality more.

## Summary
I wanted to learn the most popular front-end development tools and explore with new css animations. I have included text animations to slide in the content at the beginning when you enter a page and svg animations in the loading screen when you visit the website for the first time. 

## Installation
1. Install a package manager like npm, yarn, brew. I use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) Note: npm is the standard package management system for Javascript based projects.
2. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
3. Run the command <code>npm install</code> to install project dependencies.
4. Run <code>npm run dev</code> to run a local development server.
5. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view live site.
